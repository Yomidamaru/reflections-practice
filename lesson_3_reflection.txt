When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When collaberating with others or as a means of backing up your repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To ensure that you only pull commits that improve the master. Or  so can can break off on your own an create something different.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks-GitHub "clones" a remote repository on their server  that is separate from the original, now allowing you to make your own changes without affecting the original, while still linking back to it.
Clones- Copy of repository.
Branches- Different paths of a file that exist within a repository.
